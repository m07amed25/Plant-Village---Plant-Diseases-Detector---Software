# Plant Village - Plant Diseases Detector

## 🌱 Overview
This project is a **Plant Disease Detection** system that leverages deep learning techniques to classify and identify plant diseases using leaf images. It is based on the **Plant Village** dataset and is implemented using **Flutter** for mobile and **Streamlit** for web deployment.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Plant Village Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)
- **Description:** The dataset consists of images of healthy and diseased plant leaves, categorized into different plant species and disease types.


## 🚀 Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Classification**: Utilizes CNN models to detect plant diseases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Backend**: FastAPI (if applicable)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL

## 📌 Installation & Usage

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m07amed25/Plant-Village---Plant-Diseases-Detector---Software.git
cd Plant-Village---Plant-Diseases-Detector---Software
```

### 2️⃣ Model Training (Optional)
If you wish to retrain the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** Achieved high accuracy on test dataset
- **Model Used:** CNN-based architecture (ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.)
- **Training Time:** Depends on the hardware used
